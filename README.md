FreeCodeCamp Passenger App 

This is my first try at building an app using JavaScript - based on FreeCodeCamp YouTube video - "JavaScript Programming - Full Course". 
The main gole is to get use to real life coding situations and problems that I will have to overcome to acomplish all the task; and to get use to GitHub.

I've litaraly found FCC video few minutes ago and decided to give a go, I've created new folder and hopefully by the end of the day there will be a small working app hidden here.
